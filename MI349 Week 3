<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a>When you first land on the Urban Outfitters website the large block images give the user the immediate option of viewing either men’s clothing or women’s clothing. While that obviously isn’t the only thing that UO offers, by default it’s what most people probably come to the website for. This layout is simple and gives the “80” what they want when they want to visit the website.</a></font></br></br>

<font face="Verdana" size="5"><h2>Chunking</h2></font><br/>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a>When you scroll down on the homepage of the New York Times webpage, the broken down sections are categorized by the different types of news articles. Each “chunk” gives the headlines of the category, such as Fashion & Style, Politics, and Movies, in addition to respective ledes for the headlines. This style is clean, concise, and gives the reader blocks of information without being too overwhelming or too vague.</a></font></br></br>

<font face="Verdana" size="5"><h2>Signal to Noise</h2></font><br/>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a>The layout of the Nike website is very minimal and bright with the white background with the pops of color from the sneakers in the images. The text links at the top of the page are a neutral shade of gray which are not distracting from the overall aesthetic, yet they serve their purpose as the sites table of contents. The images themselves are of a minimalist aesthetic but are powerful and draws you in, prompting you to click the image which is a link to the Nike store where you can purchase from the line that is being promoted. </a></font></br></br>

<font face="Verdana" size="5"><h2>Rule of Thirds</h2></font><br/>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a>The Blavity website is similar to the format of the New York Times, but to the eye, the format of the chunks are more distinctive of the Rule of Thirds. Unlike the NYT, however, the Blavity thirds are individual stories with the respective image and link.</a></font></br></br>

<font face="Verdana" size="5"><h2>Hick's Law</h2></font><br/>
<font face="Verdana" size="2"><a>After learning about Hick’s law, I immediately thought about the aesthetic of the streaming website Hulu. It gives the user only a few options to click on which limits the user’s thinking time, so they can either log it to the site or try a free trial (unless they of course scroll down or leave the site). But in the moment of impact for the user, there is not a lot to think about and makes an effective marketing strategy that entices people with a free trial.</a></font></br></br>
